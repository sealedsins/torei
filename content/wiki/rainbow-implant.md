**Rainbow Implant** is a type of subdermal [implant](/tag/implant) designed to stimulate the nerves in erogenous zones. The name "rainbow" comes from the subcutaneous glow that the implants give off when they are activated, with different colors indicating the specific setting or sensation that is active.

<!--
## History

The first rainbow implant was first developed by the [Ministry of Improvements](/wiki/ministry-of-improvements). It was originally intended to be used for medical purposes, such as treating sexual dysfunction or low libido. However, over time, it became clear that the implant had a much broader appeal, particularly among the population of Torei who valued sexual pleasure and experimentation.

## Design & Construction

Rainbow implants are stimulation devices constructed from a combination of organic and synthetic materials. They are designed to be implanted beneath the skin, usually in erogenous hot spots, and have a subcutaneous glow when activated. The device is capable of inducing a wide range of sensations in the nerves of the area it is implanted, from sexual pleasure to extreme pain.

## Installation

The installation of a rainbow implant requires surgery and must be performed by a qualified professional certified by the [Ministry of Improvements](/wiki/ministry-of-improvements). The area where the implant is to be placed is first numbed with a local anesthetic. The implant is then inserted beneath the skin using a specialized implantation tool. After the implant is in place, the incision is closed and allowed to heal. The entire procedure takes only a few hours, and most individuals are able to return to their daily activities shortly thereafter.

<!-- These kind of implants are designed to be permanent, and cannot be removed once it has been implanted. This means that individuals who receive the implant will be subject to its effects for the rest of their lives. -->

## Function

Once activated, a rainbow implant can induce a wide range of sensations in the nerves in the surrounding area. These sensations can vary depending on the specific settings programmed into the device, and can range from sexual pleasure to more general feelings of pleasure or even pain. The color of the implant can also change, depending on the specific setting that is active, making it easy for users to see which specific sensation is being experienced.

Rainbow implants are often used as a reward for [slaves](/wiki/slavery), providing them with heightened sensations and pleasure. This is a well-established practice within Torean society and is considered a luxury item for many.

## Side effects

While use of rainbow implants is generally safe, there are some potential side effects to consider. The most common side effect is a temporary increase in anxiety or agitation, which usually subsides after a few days.

In rare cases, the rainbow implant can also cause psychological or emotional side effects, such as addiction or dependence on the sensations provided by the implant. It is important for individuals who are considering the installation of a rainbow implant to carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks before undergoing the procedure.

## Availability

Rainbow implants are currently only available on [Torei](/wiki/torei), where they are primarily used by the wealthy and powerful as a means of enhancing their sexual pleasure. The implant is also commonly implanted into slaves as a form of reward, allowing them to experience the same pleasures as their owners.

Despite the risks associated with the implant, it remains a popular and sought-after device among those who value sexual pleasure and dominance. However, there are growing concerns about the ethics of using such devices, particularly when implanted into slaves who have no say in the matter.
