**Rainbow implant** is a type of neural implant that greatly increases the sex drive of the person who receives it. It has been used extensively on [Torei](/wiki/torei), where it is often implanted into [slaves](/wiki/slaves) as a form of reward. Despite its popularity, the rainbow implant has also been the subject of controversy and debate.

## History

The first rainbow implant was first developed by the [Ministry of Improvements](/wiki/ministry-of-improvements). It was originally intended to be used for medical purposes, such as treating sexual dysfunction or low libido. However, over time, it became clear that the implant had a much broader appeal, particularly among the population of Torei who valued sexual pleasure and experimentation.

## Installation

The installation of a rainbow implant is a highly invasive procedure that involves the insertion of a small, rainbow-colored device into the base of the skull. It is inserted into the brain through a small incision, where it is then connected to the central nervous system. The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia and can take several hours to complete.

These kind of implants are designed to be permanent, and cannot be removed once it has been implanted. This means that individuals who receive the implant will be subject to its effects for the rest of their lives.

## Function

Rainbow implants work by stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain, increasing the person's sex drive and enhancing their sensitivity to sexual stimuli. They can be programmed to respond to different triggers, including physical touch, visual stimulation, and even certain scents.

The effects of a rainbow implant can vary from person to person, with some experiencing intense pleasure and heightened sensations, while others may become overwhelmed or even addicted to the sensation.

## Side Effects

While use of rainbow implants is generally safe, there are some potential side effects to consider. The most common side effect is a temporary increase in anxiety or agitation, which usually subsides after a few days.

In rare cases, the implant can cause permanent damage to the brain or nervous system. Additionally, individuals with a history of mental illness or neurological disorders may be at an increased risk of experiencing negative side effects.

## Availability

Rainbow implants are currently only available on [Torei](/wiki/torei), where they are primarily used by the wealthy and powerful as a means of enhancing their sexual pleasure. The implant is also commonly implanted into slaves as a form of reward, allowing them to experience the same pleasures as their owners.

Despite the risks associated with the implant, it remains a popular and sought-after device among those who value sexual pleasure and dominance. However, there are growing concerns about the ethics of using such devices, particularly when implanted into slaves who have no say in the matter.
