**Control collar** is a type of wearable device commonly used on [Torei](/wiki/torei). It is designed to track and monitor the wearer's movements, actions, and vital signs, and is often used for controlling [slaves](/wiki/slavery) or individuals deemed to be threats to society.

## Design & Construction

Control collar are typically made of a polished stainless steel. They are designed to fit snugly around the wearer's neck, with a locking mechanism that prevents it from being removed without the proper authorization. The collar is equipped with a variety of sensors and transmitters that allow it to constantly monitor the wearer's location, heart rate, body temperature, and other vital signs.

## Function

Control collars have two main uses on Torei - slavery and prisoner tracking. In both cases, the collar is used to keep a constant eye on the wearer and prevent them from escaping or breaking the law.

In slavery, control collars are mandatory in many [ringdoms](/wiki/ringdom). The collar allows the owner to track the location of the slave at all times, ensuring that they do not try to escape. If a slave attempts to leave the designated area or engage in unauthorized activities, the collar will emit a warning signal or even administer a shock to the wearer. In some cases, the collar may also be programmed to administer drugs or other forms of punishment to the wearer.

In the case of prisoners, control collars are used to prevent escape attempts and to track the location of the prisoner at all times. The collar is often combined with a [prison suit](/wiki/prison-suit), which are usually equipped with additional restraints and security measures to prevent escape attempts. If the prisoner attempts to remove the collar, it will send an alarm signal to the prison authorities, allowing them to take action.

## Controversy

The use of control collars has been the subject of much controversy throughout Torei. Many argue that the collars are a necessary tool for maintaining order and discipline among slaves and imprisoned individuals. Supporters of the collars argue that they help to prevent disobedience and promote compliance with the rules and regulations set by the owner.

Opponents of the control collars, however, argue that they are a violation of personal dignity. They argue that the collars are demeaning and dehumanizing, and that they represent a form of psychological and physical torture. Some opponents have even gone so far as to call for a ban on the use of control collars, citing their potential for abuse and misuse.

Despite the controversy surrounding the control collar, it remains a widely-used device in Torean society. Its construction and capabilities continue to be improved, with new features and functions being added on a regular basis.
