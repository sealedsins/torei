**Control collar** is a type of wearable tracking device commonly used on [Torei](/wiki/torei).

## Design & Construction

Control collars are typically made of a polished stainless steel. They are designed to fit snugly around the wearer's neck, with a locking mechanism that prevents it from being removed without the proper authorization. The collar is usually equipped with a variety of sensors and communication devices, allowing it to track information about the wearer's location and vital signs.

The design of the control collar is intended to be as unobtrusive as possible, while still providing maximum control over the wearer. The collar is usually simple in appearance, with no unnecessary adornments or decorations. The collar is also designed to be durable and long-lasting, able to withstand the wear and tear of everyday use.

## Function

The primary function of a control collar is to monitor its wearer. It can be programmed to restrict their movement within a certain area, or to allow them limited freedom of movement within a specified range. It can also be used to administer shocks or other punishments in response to disobedience or other infractions.

Control collars are mandatory for slaves in many [ringdoms](/wiki/ringdom). In addition to tracking the movements of the wearer, the collar can also be used to monitor their vital signs and other important health data. This allows for early detection and treatment of medical issues, and can help to prevent serious health problems from developing.

In the case of prisoners, control collars are used to prevent escape attempts and to track the location of the prisoner at all times. The collar is often combined with a [prison suit](/wiki/prison-suit), which are usually equipped with additional restraints and security measures to prevent escape attempts. If the prisoner attempts to remove the collar, it will send an alarm signal to the prison authorities, allowing them to take action.

## Controversy

The use of control collars has been the subject of much controversy throughout Torei. Many argue that the collars are a necessary tool for maintaining order and discipline among slaves and imprisoned individuals. Supporters of the collars argue that they help to prevent disobedience and promote compliance with the rules and regulations set by the owner.

Opponents of the control collars, however, argue that the collars are demeaning and dehumanizing, and that they represent a form of psychological and physical torture. Some opponents have even gone so far as to call for a ban on the use of control collars, citing their potential for abuse.

Despite the controversy surrounding the control collar, it remains a widely-used device in Torean society. Its construction and capabilities continue to be improved, with new features and functions being added on a regular basis.
