**Unisuit** is a popular type of clothing on the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei), known for its tight fit and versatility. Made entirely from a thin yet durable layer of stretchy material known as [laminate](/wiki/laminate), unisuit is a common choice of clothing for many Toreans.

## History

The origins of the unisuit can be traced back to the early days of Torean civilization, when the first settlers arrived on the planet and began to experiment with new materials and designs for their clothing. Initially, Toreans wore traditional garments made from natural fibers, such as wool and silk. But as the planet's harsh climate and rugged terrain began to take its toll on these fabrics, Toreans began to look for alternatives.

It was during this time that the [laminate](/wiki/laminate) material was first developed. Created through a combination of organic and synthetic materials, laminate was durable, lightweight and easy to shape into any form or color. It quickly became the go-to material for Torean clothing, and the unisuit emerged as the most popular garment made from it.

## Design & Construction

Unisuit is a single piece of clothing that covers the entire body, from neck to toe. It is made of [laminate](/wiki/laminate), which is a thin yet durable layer of material that looks and behaves much like latex but is far stronger and breathes better for long-term wear.

Unisuits are usually designed to accentuate the curves and contours of the body, making them a popular choice for those seeking to make a bold fashion statement. They are often customized with various accessories, such as gloves, boots, and headgear, to create a complete outfit.

## Function

Unisuit is a versatile and multifunctional piece of clothing. It can be used for a wide range of different activities, including athletic training, outdoor exploration, and everyday wear. Its form-fitting design allows it to provide a high level of support and protection, while also allowing the wearer to move freely and comfortably.

One of the key features of the unisuit is its ability to mimic the look and feel of a wide range of different fabrics. This allows it to be customized to the wearer's preferences, and makes it an extremely versatile piece of clothing that can be worn in a variety of different settings.

## Controversy

Despite its widespread popularity on Torei, unisuits have been the subject of controversy among [off-worlders](/wiki/off-worlder) who have visited the planet. Many of them have expressed discomfort at the idea of wearing such revealing clothing, and have called on the Torean government to respect their cultural differences and offer alternative clothing options. Some have argued that the unisuit is a form of oppression, as it is often associated with the practice of slavery on Torei.

Despite the controversy, unisuit remains one of the most popular clothing items on Torei, and is likely to continue to be so for many years to come. Its unique design and construction make it a testament to Torean ingenuity and innovation, and a symbol of their ability to adapt and thrive in even the harshest and most challenging environments.
