**Space elevator** is a massive transport infrastructure, linking its surface with the space above. It is one of the most significant structures on [Torei](/wiki/torei), serving as the primary means of transportation for goods and people between the planet's surface and space. It's the only space elevator on the planet, and one of the few in the known universe.

## Design & Construction

The Torean Space Elevator is a towering structure that reaches over 100,000 kilometers into space, connecting the planet's surface to a space station located at the top. The space station serves as a hub for interstellar travel, and it is the first port of call for all ships arriving at Torei.

The elevator consists of a single massive cable made of high-strength [laminate](/wiki/laminate), which is anchored to the planet's surface at the base of the elevator. The cable is supported by a series of towers and pylons, which help to distribute the weight of the cable and ensure its stability.

The construction of the Torean Space Elevator was a massive undertaking, requiring the most advanced technology and engineering techniques available. The project took over a century to complete, and it was the largest infrastructure project in Torean history.

## Function

The Torean Space Elevator is operated by a team of skilled technicians and engineers, who work around the clock to ensure that it remains operational. The elevator is an essential part of Torean infrastructure, providing a reliable and efficient means of transportation to and from the surface.

Passengers and cargo are transported to and from the space station via a series of capsules, which are attached to the elevator cables. The capsules are pressurized and air-conditioned, ensuring that passengers are safe and comfortable during their journey.

<!-- The elevator also plays an important role in the Torean economy, as it provides a means of transporting goods and resources from the surface to orbit. This has helped to spur economic growth and development across the planet, and has made Torei one of the most prosperous and technologically advanced planets in the known universe. -->

## Impact

The Torean Space Elevator has had a significant impact on Torean society, both in terms of its technological advancements and its economic impact. The elevator has made it possible for people to travel between the planet's surface and space more easily, opening up new opportunities for trade and commerce.

The elevator has also been a source of inspiration for Torean artists and writers, who have used it as a symbol of Torean technological prowess and ingenuity. Its iconic design and towering height have become a symbol of Torean culture, and it is one of the most recognizable structures on the planet.
