**Chastity belt** is a type of bondage equipment that has been used on [Torei](/wiki/torei) for centuries. These devices are designed to prevent sexual activity by locking the genitalia of the wearer behind a metal barrier. While their use has become less common in recent years, chastity belts can still be found in some households and are sometimes used as a form of punishment or control.

## Design & Construction

Most chastity belts on Torei are made of steel and covered in laminate. This makes them durable and difficult to remove without the key. The belts are designed to be worn around the waist and lock in place with a key or combination lock. The front of the belt features a metal plate that covers the genital area, and in some cases, a shield may be used to cover the anus as well.

## Function

The primary function of chastity belts on Torei is to prevent sexual activity. They are often used in BDSM relationships as a way to exert control over the submissive partner. The belt can be locked in place for a specific period of time, preventing the wearer from engaging in any sexual activity until the lock is released.

Chastity belts may also be used as a form of punishment or control in some households. Parents may use the belts to prevent their children from engaging in sexual activity, while owners may use them to prevent their slaves or servants from engaging in sexual activity without their permission.

While chastity belts can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time, some people find them to be erotic and enjoy the feeling of being controlled or denied sexual gratification. In recent years, some manufacturers have even begun to incorporate stimulation devices into their designs, allowing the wearer to experience sexual pleasure without being able to orgasm.
