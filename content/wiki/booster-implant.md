**Booster Implant** is a type of biomechanical implant that greatly enhances the physical abilities of a person. It is one of the most sought-after implants on [Torei](/wiki/torei), prized for its ability to give the wearer unparalleled strength and agility.

## History

The development of booster implants began as a way to help those who were paralyzed or otherwise physically disabled. Early versions of the technology were designed to stimulate the nervous system and provide a degree of mobility to those who would otherwise be unable to move. However, as the technology evolved, it became clear that it had the potential to do much more.

As researchers delved deeper into the workings of the human body, they discovered ways to enhance the physical abilities of healthy individuals. Early versions of the implants were crude and often ineffective, but over time they evolved into much more sophisticated devices that quickly became popular on Torei.

## Installation

The installation of a booster implant is a complex and dangerous procedure that requires a skilled surgeon. The implant itself is a small device that is inserted into the body, typically near the spine. Once in place, the implant begins to interface with the person's nervous system, enhancing their physical abilities and allowing them to perform feats that would be impossible for an unaugmented human.

## Function

Booster implants work by stimulating the body's natural systems, enhancing the production of certain hormones and chemicals that are associated with strength, endurance, and agility. The implant also interfaces with the person's nervous system, allowing them to control their movements with greater precision and accuracy.

The degree of enhancement provided by booster implants may vary depending on the specific implant and the needs of the user. Some implants are designed to enhance strength and speed, while others are focused on endurance or agility.

## Side Effects

While the benefits of booster implants are impressive, there are also significant risks and side effects associated with its use. The implant can put a tremendous strain on the body, and many people who have received the implant have reported experiencing chronic pain, muscle spasms, and other physical problems.

There are also significant psychological risks associated with the use of implant. Some people report feeling invincible or even godlike after receiving the implant, which can lead to reckless behavior and a disregard for personal safety.

## Availability

Booster implants are available to a limited extent on Torei, and are typically only given to individuals who are deemed to be physically capable of handling the enhanced abilities that come with the implant. They are highly regulated by the [government](/wiki/triune-ministries), and are only available through approved medical facilities.

Despite their many benefits, booster implants remain a controversial subject on Torei. Many individuals believe that the risks and side effects associated with the implants outweigh their benefits, and there is a growing movement to ban them altogether. However, for those who are able to receive them, booster implant can offer a significant boost to their physical abilities, allowing them to achieve feats that would otherwise be impossible.
