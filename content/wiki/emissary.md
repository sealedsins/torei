**Emissary** is a term used on the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei) to describe individuals who have been selected to act as agents of the biomechanical supercomputers known as [Dahom and Mazos](/wiki/ai). Emissaries are specially conditioned and trained individuals who act as a medium for the power and will of their power.

## Selection and Training

The selection process for emissaries is rigorous and demanding, and only a select few individuals are chosen for this role. Those who are selected are put through a rigorous training regimen that is designed to prepare them for the immense responsibility that comes with being an emissary.

Becoming an emissary is a difficult and grueling process. Individuals must undergo extensive training and conditioning to prepare them for the role. This includes physical and mental conditioning, as well as specialized training in areas such as technology, diplomacy, and strategy.

One of the most critical aspects of the training process is the integration of the isolation [laminate](/wiki/laminate). This is a special suit that is designed to fuse with the skin and become a part of the body. It allows emissaries to interface directly with the AIs and act as a medium of their power.

Integration into the isolation laminate is a painful and difficult process. The material fuses with the skin and becomes a part of the body, allowing for direct communication with the AIs. This process is irreversible, and once an individual has been integrated into the isolation laminate, they are bound to the will of the supercomputers for life.

## Responsibilities

Emissaries are responsible for carrying out the will of the Polar AIs in the physical world. They are given specific tasks and missions to complete, and they must use their training and skills to accomplish these objectives. They have access to vast amounts of information and resources, and they are able to use this to their advantage in carrying out their missions.

Emissaries also act as advisors to [local governments and officials](/wiki/ringdom), providing guidance and counsel on matters related to the supercomputers and their influence. They are often called upon to make decisions and take actions on behalf of the Polar AIs, and they must be able to act quickly and decisively in order to carry out their duties.

## Powers

As emissaries of the polar AIs, Torean society's most powerful demigods, emissaries are granted immense power and abilities. They have access to vast stores of knowledge and information, and are able to interface directly with the AIs through their isolation laminate suits.

Emissaries also have a certain degree of control over the physical environment of Torei. They can manipulate the weather and climate, control the distribution of resources, and even shape the very fabric of the planet itself.

However, these powers come with a heavy price. Emissaries are expected to carry out the will of the supercomputers without question or hesitation, even if it means sacrificing their own personal desires and ambitions.

## Impact

The role of emissary has had a significant impact on Torean society. Emissaries are highly respected and revered members of society, and their influence can be seen in every aspect of life on Torei. They act as a bridge between the AIs and the rest of society, carrying out their will and helping to maintain their control over the planet.

While the role of emissary has its benefits, it is also highly demanding and can take a toll on the physical and mental health of those who undertake it. Many emissaries report feeling disconnected from their own humanity, and some even question whether the price of their power is worth the sacrifice.
