**Ringdom** is a type of political division found on the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei). Due to the planet's unique [geography and climate conditions](/wiki/climate), the habitable part of Torei covers a narrow band around the planet's equator, giving rise to a series of nations known as "ringdoms." Each of these nations is different, with its own laws, customs and culture.

## History

The history of Torean Ringdoms is shrouded in mystery, with little known about their origins or early development. What is known is that the [harsh climate](/wiki/climate) and barren landscape of Torei's [non-habitable regions](/wiki/badlands) forced the planet's human inhabitants to cluster together in the equatorial ring, where they developed the first ringdoms.

Over time, the Ringdoms became the dominant form of political organization on Torei, with each nation developing its own unique culture and social structure. The use of [laminate](/wiki/laminate) clothing and the practice of [slavery](/wiki/slavery) were common to all ringdoms, but each had its own particular customs and traditions.

Ringdoms were able to maintain their independence for many centuries, despite occasional conflicts and power struggles between neighboring nations. However, approximately two hundred years ago, the [Dahom and Mazos](/wiki/ai) emerged as sentient beings and began to exert their influence over the planet. The AIs gradually became the true masters of Torei, with the human population serving as their agents in the physical world.

AIs brought a new level of stability and order to Torean society, with the [Triune Ministries](/wiki/triune-ministries) helping to coordinate international affairs and maintain their control over the planet. While ringdoms still exist, their power and autonomy have been greatly diminished, and they are now largely subject to the whims of the AIs and their emissaries.

## Government

Ringdoms of Torei are governed by a complex system of local and international institutions. Each ringdom has its own government, which is responsible for the administration of local affairs and the implementation of the laws and customs that define the culture of the nation.

At the international level, the ringdoms are governed by the [Triune Ministries](/wiki/triune-ministries) of Torei. These ministries are responsible for the regulation of female affairs and international slave code ([Ministry of Wombs](/wiki/ministry-of-wombs)), the management of law enforcement and public order ([Ministry of Truants](/wiki/ministry-of-truants)), and the provision of healthcare, cosmetic enhancements, and other services ([Ministry of Improvements](/wiki/ministry-of-improvements)).

## Notable Ringdoms

### Aekora

**Aekora** is capital ringdom of Torei, located at the very center of the equatorial band. Aekora is home to the most advanced technology and infrastructure on the planet, and it is considered the cultural and economic center of Torei. Grand Aekora is the largest city on the planet, and it is characterized by its towering spires and advanced transport systems.

### Isha

**Isha** is a small Ringdom located to the north of Alem and is known for its advanced biotech and medical facilities. It is home to many of the best doctors and researchers on the planet, and is a hub of innovation and progress.

### Alem

**Alem** is located to the east of Aekora and is known for its fertile farmland and agricultural industry. The Ringdom is ruled by a council of matriarchs, who oversee the daily affairs of the people. Despite its rural location, Alem is known for its technological advancements in farming and biotech.

### Delto

**Delto** is located to the west of Aekora and is known for its sprawling urban centers and industrial complexes. The Ringdom is home to the largest manufacturing sector on the planet, and it is responsible for producing most of the goods that are consumed on Torei. Delto is also known for its extensive use of slave labor, which is used to fuel its economy.

## Culture

Torean culture is heavily influenced by the use of [laminate clothing](/wiki/laminate), which is used to create a wide variety of garments in a range of styles and colors. The most popular example of Torean clothing is the [unisuit](/wiki/unisuit), a laminate catsuit worn for daily use. Bondage equipment is also widely used, with waist corsets, collars, masks, and armbinders indicating social status.

The use of institutionalized slavery is another defining feature of Torean culture, with different types of slavery existing for domestic, agricultural, and industrial purposes. Slaves are subject to varying degrees of mistreatment, with some being treated almost as family members while others are subject to extreme abuse and cruelty.

The Ringdoms also have their own unique customs and traditions, with each nation developing its own particular culture. However, the influence of the [Polar AIs](/wiki/ai) and the [Triune Ministries](/wiki/triune-ministries) has led to a certain degree of cultural homogenization across the planet, with many aspects of Torean life being subject to the control of these powerful institutions.
