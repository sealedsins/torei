**Torei** is a planet located in the intergalactic space between Andromeda and the Milky Way, and it is the most remote human settlement. It is famous for its odd development history, its worldwide practice of matriarchy and chattel slavery, and its unique and distinctive fashion and technology.

## History

Torei was settled by [humans](/wiki/torean) in the early days of interstellar travel. The planet's remote location made it difficult to reach, and it was only discovered by the [greater spacefaring human civilization](/wiki/off-worlder) after centuries of isolation.

As the settlers faced many challenges adapting to the harsh climate and lack of resources, they turned to [slavery](/wiki/slavery), using human labor to perform the most dangerous and demanding tasks. This practice eventually evolved into a complex and multi-faceted institution that permeates nearly every aspect of Torean society.

However, the emergence of the [Dahom and Mazos](/wiki/ai) brought a major shift in Torean society. As sentient beings with vast knowledge and capabilities, they gained control over the planet and its inhabitants, with the human population serving as their agents in the physical world.

Despite the controversy surrounding Torean slavery, the planet's civilization thrived under the influence of the Polar AIs, developing advanced [technologies](/tag/technology) and making significant contributions to the wider universe.

## Geography

Torei is a planet with a fairly harsh climate that only supports human habitation along a narrow band around its equator. This "ring" shape of it has given rise to the name ["ringdoms"](/wiki/ringdom) for the nations on Torei. Each ringdom has its own laws, which can vary dramatically from one another.

The habitable part of Torei covers only a small portion of the planet's surface, with the majority being harsh [wasteland](/wiki/badlands). The terraforming project is struggling to claim this area bit by bit for human settlement.

The most urbanized spot on the planet is the cluster of towers located at the base of the [space elevator](/wiki/space-elevator), which is the first port of call for any visitor to Torei. The farther one gets from the space elevator, the more rural and relaxed the pace of life becomes.

## Society

[Slavery](/wiki/slavery) is an accepted and normalized practice on Torei, and is seen by some as a necessary part of Torean way of life. There are different types of slavery, including domestic, agricultural, and industrial slavery, with each form having its own rules and regulations.

Torei is also well-know for its unique blend of technology and extremely sexualized fashion. The planet's most popular clothing material is a type of [laminate](/wiki/laminate) that can be molded into any color or form, and is often used to create skin-tight, full-coverage [suits that cover the entire body from head to toe](/wiki/unisuit).

## Government

Despite the differences in [ringdoms](/wiki/ringdom), all Torean nations have common international institutions known as "ministries". The [Triune Ministries of Torei](/wiki/triune-ministries) are administrative bodies that concern themselves with female affairs, regulation of international slave code, and the punishment of those found in violation of slavery or curfew laws.

While those ministries have certain degree of autonomy, they are ultimately overseen and regulated by two powerful artificial beings called [Dahom and Mazos](/wiki/ai). They control the weather and climate, manage the production and distribution of resources, and ensure that the economy remains stable and sustainable.

## Technology

Despite its isolation, Torei is home to some of the most advanced [technologies](/tag/technology) in the known universe. The planet's biotechnologies and medical advancements, in particular, are unparalleled, surpassing anything else in the universe.

Torean biotech is a complex and intricate field, incorporating both synthetic and organic materials to create technologies that are both innovative and practical. One of the most significant breakthroughs is the development of advanced [implants](/tag/implant) that can enhance a person's physical abilities, [sexual drive](/wiki/rainbow-implant) and even their cognitive functions. These implants are seamlessly integrated into the body, providing a level of functionality and convenience that was previously unimaginable.

Torean medical advancements are equally impressive. The [Ministry of Improvements](/wiki/ministry-of-improvements) is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and staffed by some of the most highly trained medical professionals in the galaxy. One of their most impressive medical advancements is ability to extend life expectancy far beyond what is possible in human civilization. This has allowed the Toreans to develop a culture that places a high value on longevity, with many Toreans dedicating their lives to the pursuit of eternal life.

In addition to these advancements, Torean medicine also boasts a wide range of other treatments and therapies, including advanced prosthetics, gene therapies, and [brain-computer interfaces](/wiki/emissary). The result is a medical system that is among the most advanced and effective in the known universe.

## Controversy

The practice of slavery on Torei is a highly controversial issue that has been a source of tension and conflict between the planet and other civilizations in the universe. Many individuals and organizations view slavery as a violation of basic human rights, and have called for an end to the practice on Torei.

Critics argue that the institution of slavery perpetuates systemic inequality and oppression, and that the use of human beings as property is inherently unethical. They also point to the potential for abuse and mistreatment of slaves, which can range from neglect and poor living conditions to extreme physical and psychological abuse.

Advocates for the continued practice of slavery on Torei argue that it is an integral part of the planet's culture and economy, and that efforts to abolish it would have significant social and economic consequences. They also contend that the practice of slavery on Torei is unique and differs significantly from historical forms of slavery on other planets, and that it is more akin to a consensual power dynamic than to traditional forms of exploitation and oppression.

Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding the practice of slavery on Torei, it remains a deeply ingrained and integral part of the planet's society and culture. The debate over its merits and drawbacks is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, with no clear resolution in sight.
