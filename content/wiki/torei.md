**Torei** is a planet located in the intergalactic space between Andromeda and the Milky Way, and it is the most remote human settlement. It is famous for its odd development history and worldwide practice of chattel [slavery](/wiki/slavery).

## History

Torei was settled by [humans](/wiki/toreans) in the early days of interstellar travel. The planet's remote location made it difficult to reach, and it was only discovered by the [greater spacefaring human civilization](/wiki/off-worlder) after centuries of isolation.

As the settlers faced many challenges adapting to the harsh climate and lack of resources, they turned to [slavery](/wiki/slavery), using human labor to perform the most dangerous and demanding tasks. This practice eventually evolved into a complex and multi-faceted institution that permeates nearly every aspect of Torean society.

However, the emergence of the [Dahom and Mazos](/wiki/ai) brought a major shift in Torean society. As sentient beings with vast knowledge and capabilities, they gained control over the planet and its inhabitants, with the human population serving as their agents in the physical world.

Despite the controversy surrounding Torean slavery, the planet's civilization thrived under the influence of the Polar AIs, developing advanced technologies and making significant contributions to the wider universe.

## Geography

Torei geography is characterized by a narrow habitable zone that covers a fairly narrow band around the planet's equator. This area is known as the "ring," and the nations on Torei are called ["ringdoms"](/wiki/ringdom). Each ringdom is different, with its own unique culture, laws, and regulations. The [climate](/wiki/climate) of the ring is defined by two seasons - rainy, with frequent storms and waterfalls, and dry, defined by draughts and dust storms.

Most of the surface of the planet between the equatorial band and the poles is a [harsh wasteland](/wiki/badlands). The terraforming project struggles to claim this area, bit by bit, for human settlement, but it remains a dangerous and inhospitable place.

The most urbanized spot on Torei is located at the base of the planet's single [space elevator](/wiki/space-elevator), which leads up to the space station at the top. The space elevator is the primary means of transportation on and off the planet, and it is used to transport people, goods, and resources to and from the planet's surface.

## Society

<!-- [Slavery](/wiki/slavery) is an accepted and normalized practice on Torei, and is seen by some as a necessary part of Torean way of life. There are different types of slavery, including domestic, agricultural, and industrial slavery, with each form having its own rules and regulations. -->

One of the most notable aspects of Torean society is the prevalence of formal institutionalized [slavery](/wiki/slavery), which is legal and protected by planetary government. The status of a slave can also vary greatly, with some being treated almost as family members, while others are subject to extreme abuse and cruelty.

Another notable aspect of Torean society is the fact that [women vastly outnumber men on the planet](/wiki/toreans), with the exact reason for this being unknown. This has led to a societal structure where women hold most of the power and influence, with many Torean ringdoms being matriarchal in nature.

Torei is also well-know for its extremely sexualized [fashion](/tag/fashion). The planet's most popular clothing material is a type of [laminate](/wiki/laminate) that can be molded into any color or form, and is often used to create skin-tight, full-coverage [suits](/wiki/unisuit) that cover the entire body from head to toe.

## Government

Torei is governed by a complex system of international institutions known as "ministries", which are common to all Torean Ringdoms, despite differences in local management. The [Triune Ministries of Torei](/wiki/triune-ministries) are administrative bodies that coordinate worldwide, and are feared and respected by the population of Torei.

<!-- Despite the differences in [ringdoms](/wiki/ringdom), all Torean nations have common international institutions known as "ministries". The [Triune Ministries of Torei](/wiki/triune-ministries) are administrative bodies that concern themselves with female affairs, regulation of international slave code, and the punishment of those found in violation of slavery or curfew laws. -->

While those ministries have certain degree of autonomy, they are ultimately overseen and regulated by two powerful artificial beings called [Dahom and Mazos](/wiki/ai). Originally designed to function as a planetary smart system to help manage the terraforming project and other planetary operations, they eventually gained their own will and consciousness, becoming Torean artificial demigods.

## Technology

Despite its isolation, Torei is home to some of the most advanced [technologies](/tag/technology) in the known universe. The planet's biotechnologies and medical advancements, in particular, are unparalleled, surpassing anything else in the universe.

Torean biotech is a complex and intricate field, incorporating both synthetic and organic materials to create technologies that are both innovative and practical. One of the most significant breakthroughs is the development of advanced [implants](/tag/implant) that can enhance a person's physical abilities, [sexual drive](/wiki/rainbow-implant) and even their cognitive functions. These implants are seamlessly integrated into the body, providing a level of functionality and convenience that was previously unimaginable.

Torean medical advancements are equally impressive. The [Ministry of Improvements](/wiki/ministry-of-improvements) is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and staffed by some of the most highly trained medical professionals in the galaxy. One of their most impressive medical advancements is ability to extend life expectancy far beyond what is possible in human civilization. This has allowed the Toreans to develop a culture that places a high value on longevity, with many Toreans dedicating their lives to the pursuit of eternal life.

In addition to these advancements, Torean medicine also boasts a wide range of other treatments and therapies, including advanced prosthetics, gene therapies, and [brain-computer interfaces](/wiki/emissary). The result is a medical system that is among the most advanced and effective in the known universe.

## Controversy

The practice of slavery on Torei is a highly controversial issue that has been a source of tension and conflict between the planet and other civilizations in the universe. Many individuals and organizations view slavery as a violation of basic human rights, and have called for an end to the practice on Torei.

Critics argue that the institution of slavery perpetuates systemic inequality and oppression, and that the use of human beings as property is inherently unethical. They also point to the potential for abuse and mistreatment of slaves, which can range from neglect and poor living conditions to extreme physical and psychological abuse.

Advocates for the continued practice of slavery on Torei argue that it is an integral part of the planet's culture and economy, and that efforts to abolish it would have significant social and economic consequences. They also contend that the practice of slavery on Torei is unique and differs significantly from historical forms of slavery on other planets, and that it is more akin to a consensual power dynamic than to traditional forms of exploitation and oppression.

Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding the practice of slavery on Torei, it remains a deeply ingrained and integral part of the planet's society and culture. The debate over its merits and drawbacks is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, with no clear resolution in sight.
