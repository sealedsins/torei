**Off-worlder** is a status for individuals from other planets who have come to visit, live, or work on [Torei](/wiki/torei). Despite the planet's unique culture and customs, there are many reasons why off-worlders are attracted to Torei, including its advanced technology, unparalleled biological sciences, and the potential for new and exciting experiences.

## Legal Status

The legal status of off-worlders on Torei is complex, and varies depending on a number of factors. In general, off-worlders are subject to the laws of the ringdom in which they reside, but there are also a number of international laws and regulations that apply to them.

One of the most important of these is the Off-Worlder Registration Act, which requires all off-worlders to register with the [Ministry of Wombs](/wiki/ministry-of-wombs) upon arrival on Torei. Failure to do so can result in fines, imprisonment, or even [enslavement](/wiki/slavery).

Off-worlders are also subject to a different set of slavery laws than Toreans. While slavery is legal and common on Torei, off-worlders are not allowed to be enslaved without a specific permit from the [Ministry of Truants](/wiki/ministry-of-truants). This permit can be difficult to obtain, and is usually only granted for certain types of labor or as punishment for a crime.

## Cultural Differences

One of the biggest challenges facing off-worlders on Torei is the vast cultural differences between their home planets and Torean society. This can lead to a number of misunderstandings or conflicts, particularly around issues related to slavery or the treatment of women.

Off-worlders are often shocked by the prevalence of slavery on Torei, as well as the way in which it is integrated into nearly every aspect of society. Similarly, they may find it difficult to understand the complex gender dynamics of Torean culture, which are defined by matriarchy and a unique form of female dominance.

## Social Status

Off-worlders on Torei occupy a unique social status, as they are often viewed with suspicion or distrust by the native population. This is in part due to the fact that they are subject to different laws and regulations, but also because of their perceived cultural differences.

Off-worlders are often viewed as exotic or unusual, and are sometimes fetishized or objectified by Toreans. This can lead to a number of uncomfortable or even dangerous situations, particularly for off-worlders who are not used to the Torean way of life. Despite these challenges, some off-worlders have managed to integrate into Torean society, using their unique skills or abilities to gain social status and acceptance.
