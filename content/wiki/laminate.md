**Laminate** is a unique material used extensively in clothing on the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei). It is a thin, stretchy layer of material that looks and behaves much like latex, but is far stronger and more breathable. Laminate is a key component of Torean fashion, and is used to create a [wide variety of skin-tight garments](/tag/fashion).

## Properties and Production

Laminate is known for its unique properties that make it an ideal material for clothing and bondage equipment. It is thin and stretchy, allowing it to fit tightly to the body while still being comfortable to wear. At the same time, it is incredibly durable, making it resistant to tearing and puncturing.

Laminate can be molded into any desired shape or form, allowing Torean fashion designers to create a wide range of skin-tight garments that are both stylish and practical. It also can mimic the appearance of a wide range of materials, such as plastic, vinyl, leather, and even [real human skin](/wiki/skinsuit).

The production process of laminate is a closely guarded secret on Torei, and the exact ingredients and techniques used to create it are not publicly known. It is believed that laminate is made by blending together synthetic and organic materials to create a liquid form of the material. Once created, the laminate can be molded into any desired shape or form.

## Application

### Fashion

Laminate is primarily used in the production of clothing items. Its unique properties make it ideal for creating skin-tight clothing that is both comfortable and durable. That made it a popular choice for Torean fashion designers, who have used it to create a [range of distinctive and unique looks](/tag/fashion).

In addition to clothing, laminate is also used in the creation of various bondage equipment and restraints, such as corsets, collars, cuffs, armbinders, and ballet boots. These items serve to further restrict the movement of the wearer, and are often used as part of BDSM-influenced practices.

### Construction

Laminate has also found its way into the Torean construction industry. It can be used to create a variety of building materials, including flooring, wall paneling, and roofing. It is popular due to its durability, moisture resistance, and versatility. Due to its extreme stength and durability, it is also often used as a base material for a load-bearing structure composites.

### Medicine

Laminate is most commonly associated with [medical care, cosmetic enhancements, performance improvements, and the installation of various implants](/wiki/ministry-of-improvements). Torean scientists use laminate to create implants that are more comfortable, durable and compatible with human biology than any other implants in the universe.

## Law Regulation

The export of laminate from Torei is strictly regulated by the [planetary government](/tag/government). Due to its unique properties and the sensitive nature of Torean culture, the export of laminate requires a special permit from the [Ministry of Wombs](/wiki/ministry-of-wombs). Without a permit, it is illegal to transport laminate off-planet.

This regulation is in place to prevent the widespread distribution of laminate and to maintain the cultural and economic significance of the material on Torei. The planetary government views laminate as a key component of Torean society, and is committed to preserving its value and integrity.

Any attempt to smuggle laminate off-planet is a serious offense and is punishable by imprisonment or enslavement. The [Ministry of Truants](/wiki/ministry-of-truants) is responsible for enforcing the laws surrounding the export of laminate, and they take their duties very seriously.
