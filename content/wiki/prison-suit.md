**Prison suit** is a specialized garment that is worn by inmates in prisons and correctional facilities throughout the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei). It is a variation of the [slave suit](/wiki/slave-suit), a form of clothing that is widely used in the Torean society for those in a position of subservience.

## Design and Construction

The design of the prison suit is intended to make it as difficult as possible for the wearer to remove or tamper with the garment. It covers the entire body, including the head, and features built-in restraints that can be used to immobilize the wearer's arms and legs. The gasmask with a tinted visor is also a common feature, to protect the wearer's identity and prevent them from being recognized by other inmates or guards.

Prison suits are also equipped with a range of security features that are designed to prevent unauthorized access. This includes locking zippers, embedded sensors, and even electronic shock devices that can be activated remotely in the event of an attempted escape.

The design of the suit may vary depending on the institution, but it typically consists of a plain, full-coverage laminate catsuit that covers the entire body, as well as a corset that is designed to compress the waist and prevent the prisoner from bending or twisting. The suit may also have additional restraints and security measures, such as chains or locks, to further prevent escape attempts.

## Function

The primary function of the prison suit is to ensure the security and safety of correctional facilities. The suits are intended to make it difficult for prisoners to escape or to harm themselves or others. In addition to limiting mobility, the suits also provide some protection against physical attacks, as the laminate material is resistant to cuts and punctures.

Despite their restrictive nature, prison suits are designed to be comfortable for the wearer. The laminate material allows for a wide range of motion, making it possible for inmates to perform tasks like cleaning and cooking without any hindrance.

Prison suits are typically worn for the duration of an inmate's sentence or until they are released. In some cases, inmates may be required to wear the suit as part of their parole conditions. The suits are often seen as a symbol of shame and dishonor, as they mark the wearer as a convicted criminal.

## Controversy

The use of prison suits has been controversial, with some critics arguing that they are dehumanizing and excessively restrictive. However, supporters of the suits point out that they are an effective tool for maintaining order and preventing escape attempts, and that they can help to protect both inmates and staff from harm.

Despite the controversy surrounding their use, prison suits remain a common fixture in Torean correctional facilities. They are often seen as a symbol of the strict discipline and order that is maintained in these institutions, and are considered to be an important part of the overall system of justice and law enforcement on Torei.
