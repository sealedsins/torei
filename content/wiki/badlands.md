The **Badlands** is a harsh and inhospitable region on the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei). Located between the equatorial band and the poles, it covers most of the planet's surface and is known for its [extreme weather conditions](/wiki/climate) and rugged terrain. This region has been a major challenge for the terraforming project, as it is difficult to make it habitable for humans.

## Geography

The Badlands cover a vast portion of Torei's surface, stretching for thousands of miles in all directions. The landscape is dominated by rocky outcroppings, jagged peaks, and deep canyons, which are formed by erosion and the relentless action of wind and water.

The terrain of the Badlands is incredibly challenging, with steep cliffs, treacherous ravines, and deep crevasses making travel nearly impossible. The region is also incredibly dry, with little to no rainfall throughout the year. The lack of water and vegetation makes it a difficult place for life to thrive.

## Climate

The Badlands are subject to a harsh and unpredictable climate, with extreme temperatures and frequent dust storms making life incredibly difficult. The region is characterized by two distinct seasons, a rainy season and a dry season.

During the rainy season, which lasts for several months, the Badlands experience frequent thunderstorms and torrential rainfall. This can cause flash floods and landslides, which can make travel through the region even more dangerous.

During the dry season, which lasts for the rest of the year, the Badlands are subject to intense heat and dust storms. The lack of rainfall makes it incredibly difficult for life to thrive, and many species have evolved unique adaptations to survive in this harsh environment.

## Settlements

Despite the dangers of the Badlands, there are a few human settlements located within its borders. These are generally small, isolated communities that are primarily focused on survival. The inhabitants of the Badlands are typically outcasts or fugitives from Torean society, who have chosen to live in the wasteland to escape the strict laws and regulations of the [ringdoms](/wiki/ringdom). These settlements are often hidden and difficult to find, making them a popular destination for those looking to disappear.

## Economic Importance

Despite their harsh and inhospitable nature, the Badlands are a vital component of Torean economics. The region is rich in valuable minerals and resources, including rare metals and compounds that are vital to the planet's industrial and technological development.

As a result, the Badlands have become a major source of wealth and power for those who control them. Many of the planet's largest and most influential corporations have their roots in the Badlands, and the region is home to some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals on the planet.

## Settlements

Despite the harsh conditions of the Badlands, there are many settlements located throughout the area. These settlements are often remote, isolated communities that are made up of people who have chosen to disappear from society or who are attempting to escape the law. They are often located in the most inhospitable areas of the Badlands, where it is difficult for outsiders to reach them.

The settlements in the Badlands are often self-sufficient, relying on their own resources and infrastructure to survive. They are often organized around small communities or families, and the people who live there are fiercely independent and self-reliant. They have developed their own unique culture and way of life, and are often suspicious of outsiders.
