**Slave suit** is a distinctive garment worn by [slaves](/wiki/slavery) on the planet Torei. Made of a thin and durable layer of [laminate](/wiki/laminate), the suit is designed to be skin-tight and cover the wearer's entire body from neck to toes.

## History

The history of the slave suit is long and complicated. It is believed to have originated in the harsh environment of the [Badlands](/wiki/badlands), where [survival suits](/wiki/survival-suit) were developed to help people endure the unforgiving climate. As [slavery](/wiki/slavery) became more common on Torei, these survival suits were adapted for use by slaves, with the addition of restraints and other bondage equipment.

Over time, slave suits became a symbol of the power dynamic between slave and master. Slaves who were forced to wear them were often treated as little more than property, with their movements and actions controlled by their masters.

## Design & Construction

Slave suit is a full-coverage laminate catsuit, usually with a corset and a gasmask with a tinted visor. It is intended to completely cover the wearer's body, obscuring their identity and removing any sense of individuality.

The design of the suit is intentionally restrictive, with a form-fitting shape that accentuates the curves of the wearer's body. It is typically custom-fitted to the wearer's body, with each suit being tailored to their unique measurements. This ensures that the suit fits snugly against the wearer's skin, enhancing their curves and giving them a sleek and sexy appearance.

One of the most distinctive features of the slave suit is its use of locks and other restraints. Many suits are fitted with locks on the zippers, making it impossible for the wearer to remove the suit without their owner's permission. Some suits are also fitted with additional restraints, such as cuffs or collars, to further restrict the wearer's movements.

## Function

Slave suits are an integral part of Torean culture, and they are often associated with a range of complex social and cultural meanings. For many, the suit is a symbol of submission and domination, with the wearer being seen as a willing participant in their own subjugation. For others, the suit is a mark of shame and humiliation, a reminder of their status as property rather than free individuals.

The uniformity of the slave suit is also an important aspect of its design. In some ringdoms nearly all slaves in Torean society are required to wear these suits, they serve to erase many of the distinctions between individual slaves. This can make it difficult for slaves to assert their own identity or to form meaningful social connections with one another.

## Legal Status

While the practice of institutionalized slavery is legal and regulated by the planetary government, the use of slave suits is not universally accepted. Some [ringdoms](/wiki/ringdom) and households require their slaves to wear the suits as a symbol of their status and subservience, while others view them as a form of unnecessary cruelty.

There are no universal laws regulating the use of slave suits, and their legality varies depending on local customs and regulations. Nonetheless, they remain a common sight on Torean streets, particularly in urban areas where slavery is more prevalent.

## Controversy

The use of slave suits in the practice of formal institutionalized slavery on Torei has been a source of controversy and debate for many years. Critics argue that the use of such restrictive and dehumanizing clothing is a violation of basic human rights, and that it perpetuates a system of oppression and abuse.

Proponents argue that it is a necessary tool for maintaining control over submissive individuals, and that it can be used in a safe and consensual manner. They also point out that the use of the slave suit is regulated by the [Ministry of Truants](/wiki/ministry-of-truants), which sets strict guidelines and rules for its use.

Despite the controversy surrounding the use of the slave suit, it remains a common and widely used piece of clothing in the world of institutionalized slavery on Torei. Its sleek and sophisticated appearance, combined with its practical function as a means of exerting control, make it a popular choice among masters and mistresses alike.
