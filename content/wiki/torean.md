**Toreans** are the native human inhabitants of the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei). Toreans are known for their unique culture, which is heavily influenced by the use of a special material known as [laminate](/wiki/laminate), as well as their worldwide practice of matriarchy and [chattel slavery](/wiki/slavery).

## Biology

One of the most unique aspects of Torean biology is their gender ratio. On Torei, females outnumber males by a ratio of nine to one. The exact reason for this unusual imbalance is not fully understood, but it is believed to be the result of a combination of genetic factors and environmental conditions on the planet.

Toreans also have a sexual drive higher than any ordinary [off-worlder](/wiki/off-worlder) human, which is believed to be related to their unusual gender ratio. This drive is a fundamental aspect of Torean culture and is celebrated in various ways throughout the planet. Many Torean societies are matriarchal, with women taking on positions of power and control.

## Culture

Torean culture is defined by a number of unique characteristics, including their love of highly sexualized power dynamics and the widespread practice of [slavery](/wiki/slavery). These practices are deeply ingrained in Torean society and are often viewed through the lens of dominance and submission.

[Slavery](/wiki/slavery) on Torei is a complex and multi-faceted institution that permeates nearly every aspect of society. It is legal and protected by planetary government, with various forms of institutionalized slavery existing throughout the planet. The status of a slave can vary greatly, with some being treated almost as family members, while others are subject to extreme abuse and cruelty.

Torean [fashion](/tag/fashion) is heavily influenced by the use of a material known as ["laminate"](/wiki/laminate). This thin, durable material is used to create clothing that is both stretchy and breathable, making it perfect for the Torean climate. It can be easily molded into any color or form, allowing for a wide range of unique and individualistic styles.
