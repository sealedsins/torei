**Laminate bed** is a unique and versatile piece of technology that is widely used on [Torei](/wiki/torei). This bed is made entirely of [laminate](/wiki/laminate) and is designed to completely encase the occupant within two sheets, creating a vacuum-sealed environment that offers a range of applications.

## Design & Construction

The laminate bed is designed to provide a comfortable and secure environment for the occupant. When fully sealed, it completely encases the occupant within two laminate sheets, which helps to protect the occupant from external factors such as dust or air pollution. The bed is typically equipped with a breath tube, allowing the occupant to breathe normally while inside, but some simplier versions could include just a simple breath hole.

In some cases, the laminate bed may be fitted with integrated catheters, ensuring the occupant's comfort and safety for a long-term use. The bed may also be equipped with special inhaler that is able to keep the occupant asleep or in an altered state of consciousness for extended periods of time.

## Function

The laminate bed has a variety of uses on Torei, and can be found in a number of different settings. One of its most common uses is in the medical field, where it is used to provide a controlled environment for patients undergoing treatment for serious illnesses or injuries. The bed's sealed design helps to prevent the spread of disease and infection, while providing continuous monitoring of the patient's vital signs.

The bed is also commonly used for sexual pleasure, where it is used to provide a unique and immersive experience for couples or individuals. The vacuum seal and laminate material create a tight, [almost womb-like environment](/stories/special-gift) that heightens the senses and intensifies sexual pleasure.

In addition to these applications, the laminate bed is also used as a means of transport for long-distance travel. The compact and sealed nature of the bed makes it an ideal way to transport someone across vast distances within a minimal space, while also providing a reasonable level of comfort and safety. This is particularly useful in the harsh and [unforgiving environment](/wiki/badlands) of Torei, where long journeys can be dangerous and difficult.

Finally, while being versatile and useful in a variety of settings, laminate bed also has a darker side - it is sometimes used as a form of punishment. Individuals who violate the laws may find themselves confined to a laminate bed for extended periods of time, completely encased and unable to move or communicate with the outside world. The tight, isolated environment may induce a sense of claustrophobia and anxiety, making it a highly effective form of psychological torture.
