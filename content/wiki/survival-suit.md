**Survival Suit** is a specialized [laminate](/wiki/laminate) suit developed for survival in the harsh conditions outside of the habitable areas on the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei). It is a critical piece of equipment for anyone venturing into the dangerous [badlands](/wiki/badlands) or other hazardous environments.

## History

The first survival suits were developed shortly after the terraforming project began on Torei. The [harsh conditions of the badlands](/wiki/climate), with their extreme temperatures, deadly radiation, and toxic atmosphere, made it clear that a specialized suit would be needed to keep people safe while exploring and working in these areas.

Over time, the design of the suit evolved, incorporating the latest advances in Torean biotech and materials science. Today, survival suits are considered to be one of the most advanced pieces of equipment on the planet, and are widely used by a variety of industries, including mining, exploration, and military operations.

## Design & Construction

Survival suits are made of a specially-conditioned [laminate material](/wiki/laminate) that is lightweight, durable, and breathable. They are able to protect the wearer from extreme temperatures, radiation, and other environmental hazards, while also allowing for a full range of movement and flexibility.

The suit is typically equipped with a helmet that provides air filtration and climate control, as well as a variety of sensors and other monitoring equipment. It also features integrated communications gear, allowing wearers to stay in contact with their team members and the outside world.

## Function

Survival suits are designed to keep wearers alive and safe in the most extreme environments imaginable. They are able to protect against a wide range of hazards, including extreme temperatures, radiation, toxic gases, and more. The suit also features a range of emergency systems, including oxygen and water supplies, that can keep wearers alive for extended periods of time in the event of a catastrophic failure.

Its advanced design and construction make it an essential piece of equipment for anyone working or exploring outside of the habitable areas on Torei. It is widely used by a variety of industries, as well as by military and scientific personnel.

## Impact

The survival suit has had a significant influence on the planet's culture and society, particularly in the way that people think about and approach the environment. The suit has helped to open up new areas of the planet for exploration and settlement, and has made it possible for people to survive in conditions that were once thought to be impossible.

However, the use of the suit has also been controversial, particularly in the context of Torean [slavery](/wiki/slavery). The [slave suit](/wiki/slave-suit), which is a modified version of the survival suit, is commonly used to protect slaves who are sent out into the Badlands to perform manual labor. Critics argue that the use of the suit is inhumane and degrading, and that it serves to reinforce the oppressive and exploitative nature of Torean slavery.
