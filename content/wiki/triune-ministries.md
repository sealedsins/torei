**Triune Ministries** is the collective term used to describe the three administrative bodies that are common to all Torean Ringdoms: the [Ministry of Wombs](/wiki/ministry-of-wombs), the [Ministry of Truants](/wiki/ministry-of-truants), and the [Ministry of Improvements](/wiki/ministry-of-improvements). These ministries are responsible for overseeing different aspects of [Torean](/wiki/torei) society, and each one plays a unique role in maintaining the order and stability of the ringdoms.

<!-- Together, these ministries form the backbone of [Torean](/wiki/torei) society, helping to maintain the order and stability of the ringdoms. While they are each responsible for different aspects of life in the ringdoms, they work closely together to ensure that the needs of the population are met and that the laws and regulations of the ringdoms are enforced. -->
