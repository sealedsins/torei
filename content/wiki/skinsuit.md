**Skinsuit** is a unique and innovative form of clothing that has become increasingly popular on the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei). Made of a special type of [laminate](/wiki/laminate), skinsuits are designed to mimic the appearance and texture of human skin, creating a natural and lifelike look.

## History

The origins of skinsuits are unclear, but they are believed to have been developed in response to the Torean obsession with physical beauty and perfection. By creating a suit that could mimic the appearance of human skin, designers and scientists hoped to offer people a way to completely alter their appearance without the need for surgery or other invasive procedures.

The first skinsuits were simple and crude, with a limited range of colours and textures available. But as the technology behind them advanced, so did their capabilities. Today, skinsuits can be customised to look like any human skin tone or texture, and can even alter the wearer's body shape and proportions.

## Design & Construction

Skinsuits are custom-made garments, designed to fit the specific body shape and size of each individual wearer. The process of creating a skinsuit is highly complex and requires a great deal of skill and expertise.

The first step in creating a skinsuit is to take a detailed scan of the wearer's body, using advanced imaging technology to capture every detail and nuance of their appearance. This information is then used to create a 3D model of the wearer's body, which is used as the basis for the construction of the skinsuit.

The skinsuit is then constructed from a combination of different types of laminate, carefully crafted and molded to fit the wearer's body perfectly. The final result is a garment that is both beautiful and functional, allowing the wearer to completely alter their appearance.

## Function

Skinsuits are primarily used for cosmetic purposes, allowing people to alter their appearance in any way they choose. They can be used to cover up scars, tattoos, or other blemishes, or to completely transform the wearer's appearance. Some people choose to wear skinsuits that give them the appearance of a different gender, race, or even species.

Another popular use of skinsuits is in the world of espionage and infiltration. Because of their lifelike appearance and ability to mimic human skin, skinsuits are often used by spies and covert operatives to disguise their appearance and infiltrate enemy organizations undetected.

<!-- Skinsuits are designed to be worn like any other type of clothing, but their unique properties make them particularly interesting. The laminate material that is used to create skinsuits is incredibly stretchy and durable, allowing it to conform to the wearer's body like a second skin.

In addition to their realistic appearance, skinsuits are also incredibly comfortable to wear. The material is breathable and lightweight, making it ideal for extended periods of wear. Some people choose to wear skinsuits that give them the appearance of a different gender, race, or even species.

## Controversy

Despite their popularity, skinsuits have also been the subject of controversy on Torei. Some people have raised concerns about the ethical implications of creating a type of clothing that mimics human skin so closely, while others have criticized the technology for its potential to be used in deceptive or manipulative ways. Additionally, there are concerns about the long-term effects of wearing a skinsuit, particularly in terms of the impact on an individual's mental health and sense of self-identity.

In response to these concerns, some Torean governments have implemented regulations on the use of skinsuits. These regulations typically require individuals to register their skinsuits with the local authorities, and may require periodic check-ins to ensure that the skinsuit is being used in a responsible manner.

Despite the controversies surrounding skinsuits, they remain a popular and unique form of clothing on Torei. As the technology behind the creation of skinsuits continues to evolve, it is likely that they will become even more realistic and advanced in the future.
