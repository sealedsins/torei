**Skinsuit** is a unique and innovative form of clothing that has become increasingly popular on the planet [Torei](/wiki/torei). Made of a special type of [laminate](/wiki/laminate), skinsuits are designed to mimic the appearance and texture of human skin, creating a natural and lifelike look.

## History

The origins of skinsuits are unclear, but they are believed to have been developed in response to the Torean obsession with physical beauty and perfection. By creating a suit that could mimic the appearance of human skin, designers and scientists hoped to offer people a way to completely alter their appearance without the need for surgery or other invasive procedures.

Early versions of skinsuits were primitive and unrealistic, but as technology advanced, so did their design. Today, skinsuits can be customized to resemble any human skin tone or texture, and even alter the wearer's body shape and proportions.

## Design & Construction

Skinsuits are custom-made garments, designed to fit the specific body shape and size of each individual wearer. The process of creating a skinsuit is highly complex and requires a great deal of skill and expertise.

The first step in creating a skinsuit is to take a detailed scan of the wearer's body, using advanced imaging technology to capture every detail and nuance of their appearance. This information is then used to create a 3D model of the wearer's body, which is used as the basis for the construction of the suit.

The skinsuit is then constructed from a combination of different types of laminate, carefully crafted and molded to fit the wearer's body perfectly, producing a garment that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional.

## Function

Skinsuits are primarily used for cosmetic purposes, allowing individuals to alter their appearance in any way they desire. They can be used to conceal skin imperfections or completely transform the wearer's appearance, such as giving the illusion of a different gender, race, or even species.

Another popular use of skinsuits is in the world of espionage and infiltration. Because of their lifelike appearance and ability to mimic human skin, skinsuits are often used by spies and covert operatives to disguise their appearance and infiltrate enemy organizations undetected.

<!-- Skinsuits are designed to be worn like any other type of clothing, but their unique properties make them particularly interesting. The laminate material that is used to create skinsuits is incredibly stretchy and durable, allowing it to conform to the wearer's body like a second skin. -->

## Controversy

Despite their popularity, skinsuits have also been the subject of controversy on Torei. Some people have raised concerns about the ethical implications of creating a type of clothing that mimics human skin so closely, while others have criticized the technology for its potential to be used in deceptive or manipulative ways. Additionally, there are concerns about the long-term effects of wearing a skinsuit, particularly in terms of the impact on an individual's mental health and sense of self-identity.

In response to these concerns, some Torean governments have implemented regulations on the use of skinsuits. These regulations typically require individuals to register their skinsuits with the local authorities, and may require periodic [check-ups](/stories/skin-deep) to ensure that the skinsuit is being used in a responsible manner.

Despite the controversies surrounding skinsuits, they remain a popular and unique form of clothing on Torei. As the technology behind the creation of skinsuits continues to evolve, it is likely that they will become even more realistic and advanced in the future.
