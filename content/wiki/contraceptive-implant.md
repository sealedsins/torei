**Contraceptive Implant** is a highly advanced and effective form of birth control that is widely used throughout the [planet](/wiki/torei). It is a small, subcutaneous device that is surgically installed into the womb of a female and is designed to prevent pregnancy until it is remotely switched off.

## Design & Construction

The contraceptive implant is a small, flexible device made of a special type of laminate material that is infused with synthetic hormones. The microchip that is embedded within the implant contains highly advanced technology that is able to monitor and regulate the hormone levels of the implant wearer, preventing ovulation and ensuring that the body remains in a non-fertile state.

## Installation

The installation process for the tube implant is quick and relatively painless. A trained medical professional inserts the tube into the uterus through the cervix using a special insertion tool. The entire procedure takes only a few minutes, and most women report little to no discomfort.

## Function

The contraceptive implant works by releasing a small amount of synthetic hormone into the bloodstream over time. This hormone helps to prevent pregnancy by thickening the cervical mucus, which makes it more difficult for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Additionally, the hormone can also prevent ovulation from occurring altogether.

One of the most intriguing aspects of the contraceptive implant is the activation signal - and the logic behind it. This signal appears to be triggered by a combination of factors, including the age and health of the implant wearer, as well as their hormonal and metabolic state. The activation signal is so unpredictable that pregnancy is commonly seen as an ["act of god"](/wiki/ai) that cannot be planned for or prevented.

## Side effects

Like any medical procedure, there are potential side effects associated with the tube implant. These include irregular bleeding, weight gain, and mood changes. However, these side effects are generally mild and resolve on their own over time. In rare cases, more serious side effects may occur, such as infection or perforation of the uterus.

Persistent reports of pregnancy without any sexual contact with a male, so called "solo-births", have given rise to speculation that the tube implant may contain a cryogenically frozen sperm sample as a fail-safe against the loss of the relatively small male population. However, there is no official confirmation of this theory.
