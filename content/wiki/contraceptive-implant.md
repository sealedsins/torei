**Contraceptive Implant** is a highly advanced and effective form of birth control that is widely used throughout the planet. It is a small, subcutaneous implant that is placed just beneath the skin and releases [hormones](/wiki/hormone-implant) that prevent ovulation and pregnancy.

## History

Contraceptive implants were developed in response to the high demand for effective birth control on the planet. Torean society is highly regulated and controlled by the government, and the use of contraception is seen as an essential tool for maintaining social stability.

The first contraceptive implant was developed by the [Ministry of Improvements](/wiki/ministry-of-imporvements), which used its advanced biotech knowledge to create a device that would be both safe and effective. After extensive testing and trials, the implant was approved for use by the government, and it quickly became one of the most popular forms of birth control on the planet.

## Installation

The process of installing a contraceptive implant is a simple one, and it can be done in just a few minutes by a trained medical professional. The implant itself is a small, flexible rod that is inserted into the upper arm of the patient using a specially designed applicator.

The insertion process is quick and relatively painless, and most patients are able to resume their normal activities immediately afterwards. The implant is typically placed just under the skin, where it remains for several years, slowly releasing hormones that prevent pregnancy.

## Function

Contraceptive implant works by releasing a steady stream of hormones into the bloodstream. These hormones, typically progesterone, work to prevent ovulation, thereby preventing pregnancy.

Implants are highly effective, with a failure rate of less than 1%, making it one of the most reliable forms of birth control available. Additionally, because the implant is inserted under the skin, it is not affected by other medications or illnesses, making it an ideal option for women who may have difficulty using other forms of birth control.

## Side Effects

While contraceptive implants are generally well-tolerated, it may cause some side effects in some patients. These may include irregular bleeding, headaches, mood changes, weight gain, and acne. However, these side effects are usually mild and tend to resolve over time.

## Availability

Contraceptive implants is provided free of charge to all female citizens of Torei. The government views contraception as an essential tool for maintaining social stability, and so it is heavily subsidized and widely available to all those who need it.
