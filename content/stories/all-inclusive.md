Eve sat alone at the bar, nursing her glowing blue drink in a tall, slender glass. She raised it to her lips and took a tentative sip, feeling the cool liquid glide down her throat. The taste was a burst of flavors, with hints of sweetness and tanginess that were followed by a sharp, alcoholic bite.

Her eyes roamed over the unfamiliar faces around her. Inhabitants of [Torei](/wiki/torei), dressed in their signature latex-like laminate clothing, chatted and laughed animatedly in their native language, making Eve feel even more like an outsider.

The atmosphere in the bar was both thrilling and overwhelming. The air was thick with the scent of exotic smells and the sounds of foreign music, making her feel like she had been transported to another realm. Eve had come to this planet in search of a fresh start, but now, surrounded by these strange and vibrant people, she didn't know where to begin.

Eve beckoned the bartender for another drink, not caring how much it would cost her. She had a desperate need to forget her troubles, to lose herself in the haze of alcohol and the sensory overload of this brave new world. The bartender obliged, sliding her another glass of the glowing blue liquid.

As Eve continued to drink, her memories became increasingly hazy. She struggled to recall how she ended up at the bar or what she had been doing prior to arriving. With each passing moment, the alcohol further blurred her thoughts and senses, lowering her inhibitions and impairing her judgment.

Eventually, Eve's rational mind began to kick in, telling her that it was time to leave the bar while she was still able to walk. With a heavy head and wobbly legs, she slowly made her way towards the exit, weaving her way through the crowded bar.

But as she pushed her way through the throngs of people, Eve unintentionally bumped into another woman, causing her to spill her drink all over her. The woman turned around, her expression angry as she glared at Eve.

In a slurred voice, Eve tried to apologize, but it was too late. Angry Torean shouted something in her native language, drawing the attention of those around them. Her friends stepped forward, surrounding Eve. She tried to back away, but one of the women grabbed her arm, pulling her back into the circle.

Eve's heart raced as the women closed in on her. Fear and panic set in, and she knew that she had to defend herself. With a sudden burst of adrenaline, Eve swung her arm, punching the woman who had grabbed her right into the face.

The impact of the punch caused the woman to stumble backward, clutching her nose. Blood poured out of her nostrils, coating her jet black outfit in crimson droplets.

The victim's friends reacted immediately.

One of them grabbed Eve by the hair, pulling her head back with a sharp jerk. Another landed a punch to her stomach, causing her to double over in pain. Eve tried to defend herself, but she was outnumbered and outmatched. They knocked her down and dragged outside the bar, tossing her onto the pavement outside.

Eve's laminate clothing tore as she hit the ground, exposing her skin to the cold night air. She tried to scramble to her feet, but her vision was blurry and her movements uncoordinated. She stumbled, her hand reaching out to grab onto something to steady herself.

Suddenly, she felt a sharp blow to the back of her head, and everything went black. The last thing she remembered was the sound of the police sirens wailing in the distance.

The next thing Eve knew, she was waking up in a stark cell. Her head was pounding, and her body ached all over. The room was devoid of any personal belongings, leaving her feeling even more isolated and vulnerable. The constant humming of the fluorescent lights overhead was the only sound that filled the air.

Her head was throbbing, and her body was in excruciating pain. As she tried to get up, she noticed the dried blood and dirt on her clothes. The stench of vomit and sweat mixed in the air, making her nauseous. She stumbled towards the toilet-like contraption in the corner of the room and retched violently, her body convulsing with each heave.

Feeling weak and disoriented, she looked up at the mirror and gasped. Her once-beautiful face was now battered and bruised, with dark circles under her eyes. Her hair was tangled and matted, with bits of vomit still stuck in it.

As she leaned against the sink, trying to steady herself, she heard the sound of heavy footsteps approaching her cell. Two guards dressed in a tight laminate suits and tinted helmets entered, their faces obscured. Without warning, one of them grabbed her roughly by the arm, yanking her to her feet.

"Get up," she barked, his voice gruff and devoid of emotion. "Time to go."

As they made their way through the twisting, labyrinthine corridors of the prison, Eve's mind raced. She couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible was about to happen. The dank, claustrophobic walls of the prison seemed to press in on her from all sides, and the whispers exchanged between the guards only heightened her sense of dread.

Finally, they stopped in front of a massive metal door. One of them swiped a keycard, and the door slid open with a hiss, revealing a stark white room that momentarily blinded Eve with its harsh light. As her vision adjusted, she saw a single chair in the center of the room.

The guards motioned for her to sit down, and Eve felt a shiver run down her spine as she reluctantly complied. Eve's heart raced as she waited, her mind racing with the possibilities of what was about to happen.

Suddenly, a holographic figure materialized in front of her, its face obscured by a black mask. "Eve," the figure said sternly. "You have been found guilty of causing a disturbance and engaging in violent behavior in a public establishment. As punishment, you will be confined to the local correctional facility for a period of three months."

Eve felt her heart sink as she comprehended the severity of her situation. She had heard enough stories about Torean prisons, and the prospect of enduring three months of confinement in one filled her with dread.

The hologram continued, "You will be fitted with a [special suit](/wiki/prison-suit) that is designed to ensure compliance with prison regulations. It is a laminate garment that is form-fitting, and will restrict your movements and inhibit your speech. You will be allowed to remove it for one hour per three days for hygiene and exercise purposes, but otherwise, it will be worn at all times."

Eve's heart sank even further as she realized the implications of the outfit. She had heard rumors about those suits and knew that they were designed to be incredibly restrictive and degrading. She wondered what else would be expected of her while she was wearing it.

Masked figure persisted, "Your suit will also have a locking mechanism that will only be released upon your completion of your sentence. Attempts to remove or tamper with the suit will result in immediate punishment, which may include extension of your sentence or permanent enslavement."

Eve felt her fear and anxiety grow as she realized the full extent of her punishment. She knew that attempting to resist or fight back was futile, and so she simply nodded her head in silent acquiescence.

The hologram seemed to detect Eve's distress, and its tone softened slightly. "You will be given a chance to earn your freedom through good behavior and completing assigned tasks. However, any noncompliance or further disturbances will lead to further consequences."

The hologram then faded away, leaving Eve alone with the guards. As they began to strip her of her blood-stained clothes, Eve couldn't help but feel a sense of shame and humiliation. She had never been punished like this before, and the thought of treated like a prisoner was almost too much to bear.

Once Eve was completely naked, one of the guards started to shave her head, leaving her feeling exposed and vulnerable. She had never been without her long raven locks before and the sensation of her bare scalp against the cool air was unsettling.

As the guards finished shaving her head, they motioned for Eve to step into a small room adjacent to the chamber. Inside the room, Eve saw what looked like a shower area, and a jet of cold water immediately hit her, causing her to gasp in shock. The water was icy and relentless, hitting her body with enough force to make her stumble.

Eve gritted her teeth and tried to endure the freezing shower. She wanted to scream and cry, but she knew it would only make things worse. So she remained silent, letting the water wash away the blood from her body.

Eventually, the water stopped, and the guards led her back into the main chamber. There, they began to fit her with the prison suit, and Eve realized just how different it was from any other clothing she had ever worn before. The material was smooth and cool to the touch, but also incredibly thick and heavy.

Once the suit was pulled up over her thighs and hips, Eve felt a strange sensation in her groin area. Looking down, she saw that there were two dildos built into the suit, one in the front and one in the back. Her face flushed with embarrassment as she realized that these were designed to ensure that she was constantly stimulated, causing her to feel aroused and uncomfortable at all times.

But that wasn't all - there was also a catheter built into the suit, ensuring that she would not be able to relieve herself without permission. She tried to protest, but the guards only glared at her through their tinted helmets, making it clear that resistance was futile.

As the they finished fitting her with the suit, one of the guards pulled an attached hood over Eve's head, completely sealing her inside. It felt like a vice, squeezing her head tightly as they zipped it up. She gasped for air, trying to adjust to the sensation of the integrated gag that filled her mouth and left her completely speechless.

The tinted visor of the mask made it hard for her to see anything clearly, everything was blurry, and she couldn't make out any of the features of the jailers or her surroundings. It was like being trapped in a dream, where nothing quite made sense.

As Eve struggled to get used to the tight suit, she heard a series of beeps as the guards activated the suit's security system. Each lock snapped into place, sealing her inside the garment with a cold, metallic clank. The suit was so tight and restrictive that she could barely move her body at all.

Once she was completely locked in, the guards grabbed her by the arms and led her down a dimly lit corridor. Eve could hear the sound of her own breathing echoing loudly inside the mask as they walked. She felt like a prisoner, a mere object of ownership, with no say in her own fate.

As they walked, Eve could hear muffled voices and the sounds of other prisoners in nearby cells. She couldn't make out what they were saying, but she could sense their fear and desperation. Eve stumbled a few times, but the guards were merciless, pushing her forward with rough shoves.

Finally, they reached a familiar cell door, which slid open with a loud hiss. The guards shoved Eve roughly into the cell, causing her to stumble and fall to the ground. Before she could even pick herself up, one of the guards approached her and injected something into the port on the back of her neck.

Eve felt a sudden surge of dizziness and nausea as the drug took hold. Her limbs grew heavy and her mind clouded over. She struggled to keep her eyes open, but they refused to obey her commands, closing shut of their own accord.

Eve's body went limp as she passed out.

Hours later, Eve began to stir. She was disoriented at first, unsure of where she was or how much time had passed. It was dark in her cell, and the only sound was the low hum of machinery somewhere in the distance.

As her senses slowly returned, Eve became aware of the suit still encasing her body. It was so tight that she could barely move, and every time she shifted her position, she felt the dildos inside her shift as well, rubbing against her in the most intimate way. She desperately wanted to pee, but the suit prevented her from doing so.

Panic set in as she recalled that she was sealed inside. She clawed at the material, trying to find a way to pry it off her body, but it was no use. The suit was designed to be inescapable, and there was no way to remove it without a key.

Eve began to cry. Her tears were hot and bitter, and they streamed down her face, pooling inside the suffocating mask of the suit. She felt completely helpless, trapped in a prison of her own body.

Her sobs were muffled by the gag inside her mouth, and she could feel the hot tears mixing with the drool that was now escaping her lips. She was alone in her misery, with no one to comfort her or offer her any hope of escape.

As the minutes turned into hours, Eve's crying gradually subsided, but her discomfort only grew worse. She could feel her bladder becoming more and more full, and the dildos inside her were making her feel both uncomfortable and aroused - but there was nothing she could do about it.

Desperate for some kind of masochistic release, Eve tried to masturbate. She wriggled and squirmed, trying to find a way to touch her clit through the thick layer of laminate, but it was impossible. The suit was designed to keep her constantly stimulated but never satisfied, and it was doing its job all too well.

Eve whimpered in frustration, feeling tears of humiliation and anger prick at her eyes once again. She was trapped in a suit that constantly stimulated her but left her unable to find any kind of relief. It was torture in the truest sense of the word.

Finally, the exhaustion of the day caught up with her, and Eve drifted off into a fitful sleep, tears still streaming down her face. The suit entered the sleep mode, monitoring her every breath and move, as the darkness of the room enveloped her.

All she had now was dreams.

<!-- Overwhelmed by the sense of hopelessness and despair, Eve's body finally succumbed to exhaustion. She fell into a deep, dreamless sleep, hoping that when she woke up, the nightmare would be over. -->
