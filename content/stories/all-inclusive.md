Eve had been dreaming of visiting for months.

She had read countless articles and watched every documentary she could find about the planet's unique culture and fashion, and was eager to see it all for herself. As she stepped off the space elevator, she felt a sense of excitement and anticipation bubbling inside her.

The first few days of her trip were a whirlwind of exploration and discovery. Eve visited every boutique and shop she could find, trying on a seemingly endless array of laminate garments. She was fascinated by the way the material could be molded into any form or color, and she spent hours admiring herself in the mirror, trying on different outfits.

Eve's interest in Torean culture went beyond just fashion. She also made it a point to explore the local cuisine, which proved to be just as intriguing and unique as the planet's fashion. She tasted dishes made with exotic and unfamiliar ingredients, some of which she had never encountered before. The flavors and textures were a departure from anything she had ever experienced, and she eagerly sampled everything that was presented to her.

As the days turned into nights, Eve discovered Torei's vibrant nightlife. She hit up bars and clubs in the urban core, where she mingled with off-worlders and Toreans alike. She drank and danced the night away, feeling more alive than she ever had before.

As Eve's trip to Torei progressed, her nights out became increasingly wild and hedonistic. She found herself caught up in a world of pleasure and excess, where every desire could be indulged and every whim could be satisfied. However, as time passed, she began to feel socially detached from the people around her.

Despite the thrill of it all, Eve couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. There was a sense of emptiness that nagged at her, a feeling that all of the excitement and pleasure in the world couldn't fill. The more she tried to engage with the locals, the more she felt that she didn't belong.

Trying to numb the pain, she turned to alcohol and began drinking heavily. One night, while drinking at a local bar, Eve was confronted by a group of locals who began to harass her. Fueled by her feelings of detachment and alienation, she reacted with aggression and rage.

The situation escalated quickly, and Eve found herself in a full-blown physical altercation. Eve fought back with unexpected tenacity, powered by her alcohol-fueled adrenaline.

However, the effects of the alcohol began to take their toll on her body, and Eve's physical abilities began to decline. Her vision blurred, and her movements became sluggish. Despite this, she continued to fight, driven by a surge of adrenaline.

In a sudden burst of energy, Eve lunged at her opponent, hoping to take him down once and for all. But her aim was off, and she stumbled forward, crashing into a nearby table.

As she hit the ground, Eve's vision went black and her body went limp. The last thing she remembered was the sound of the police sirens wailing in the distance.

The next thing Eve knew, she was waking up in a stark cell. Her head was pounding, and her body ached all over. The room was devoid of any personal belongings or even a window, and the only sound came from the hum of the fluorescent lights above.

Her head was throbbing, and her body was in excruciating pain. As she tried to get up, she noticed the dried blood and dirt on her clothes. The stench of alcohol and vomit mixed in the air, making her nauseous. She stumbled towards the toilet in the corner of the room and retched violently.

Feeling weak and disoriented, she looked up at the mirror and gasped. Her once-beautiful face was now battered and bruised, with dark circles under her eyes. Her hair was tangled and matted, with bits of vomit still stuck in it.

As she leaned against the sink, trying to steady herself, she heard the sound of footsteps approaching her cell. Two guards in tinted helmets entered, their faces obscured, and Eve couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.

"Get up," one of the guards barked, grabbing her roughly by the arm. "Time to go."

Eve struggled to regain her balance as the guards led her down the labyrinthine corridors. Her head was pounding, and her thoughts were a jumbled mess. She tried to listen to the hushed whispers exchanged between the guards, but they were too low for her to make out.

As they turned a corner, the guards stopped in front of a large metal door. One of them swiped a keycard, and the door slid open with a hiss. They entered a stark white room, and Eve's eyes were momentarily blinded by the harsh light. As her vision adjusted, she saw a single chair in the center of the room.

The guards motioned for her to sit down, and Eve felt a shiver run down her spine as she complied. She glanced around nervously, taking in the faces of the officials surrounding her. They were all dressed in pristine white suits, their expressions unreadable.

One of them stepped forward, his face impassive. "Eve," he said sternly. "You have been found guilty of causing a disturbance and engaging in violent behavior in a public establishment. As punishment, you will be confined to the local correctional facility for a period of three months."

Eve felt her heart sink as she comprehended the severity of her punishment. She had heard dreadful stories about Torean prisons, and the prospect of enduring three months of confinement in one filled her with dread.

The official continued, "You will be fitted with a [special suit](/wiki/prison-suit) that is designed to ensure compliance with prison regulations. It is a laminate garment that is form-fitting, and will restrict your movements and inhibit your speech. You will be allowed to remove it for one hour per three days for hygiene and exercise purposes, but otherwise, it will be worn at all times."

Eve's heart sank even further as she realized the implications of the outfit. She had heard rumors about the prison suits and knew that they were designed to be incredibly restrictive and degrading. She wondered what else would be expected of her while she was wearing it.

The officials then left the room, leaving Eve alone with the guards. As the guards began to strip her of her blood-stained clothes, Eve couldn't help but feel a sense of shame and humiliation. She had never been punished like this before, and the thought of being forced to wear such a degrading outfit for three months was almost too much to bear.

Once Eve was completely naked, the guards proceeded to shave her head, leaving her feeling exposed and vulnerable. She had never been without her long raven locks before and the sensation of her bare scalp against the cool air was unsettling.

Then, the guards hosed her down with a cool jet of water, washing away the remaining blood and grime from her body. The water was refreshing, but it only served to remind her of her loss of freedom and the harsh reality of her situation.

Once she was completely clean, the guards began to slide the orange suit onto her body, and Eve realized just how different it was from any other garment she had ever worn before. The material was smooth and cool to the touch, but also incredibly thick and heavy. She watched nervously as the guards began to fit it onto her body, their expressions cold and emotionless.

As they pulled the suit up over her thighs and hips, Eve felt a strange sensation in her crotch. Looking down, she saw that there were two dildos built into the suit, one for her pussy and the other for her ass. But that wasn't all - there was also a catheter built into the suit, ensuring that she would not be able to relieve herself without assistance.

Eve felt her heart racing as she watched the guards fit the laminate suit onto her body. She couldn't help but feel a sense of panic rising within her, as the catheter and plugs made her feel vulnerable and exposed. She wondered what they would do to her while she was wearing this suit, and whether she would be subjected to any other kinds of humiliating treatment.

As the guards worked on her, Eve couldn't help but feel a growing sense of dread. She couldn't shake the feeling of unease and questioned her ability to endure the upcoming experience without being completely shattered. Despite her attempts to remain calm, her nerves were shot and her senses were heightened.

Once the guards had finished with her body, they began to pull an attached mask over the crown of her head. The mask had an integrated gag that completely filled her mouth, rendering her completely speechless. The tinted visor made it hard for her to see anything clearly, everything was blurry, and she couldn't make out any of the features of the guards or her surroundings. It was like being trapped in a dream, where nothing quite made sense.

As the guards finished securing the suit, they activated the security sensors inside it. A jolt of electricity ran through Eve's body, causing her to jerk. She could almost feel the sensors monitoring her every move.

The guards then began to activate the locks on the suit, sealing her in completely. She could feel the metal clicks and clanks as each lock snapped into place, trapping her inside the restrictive garment.

Once she was completely locked in, the guards grabbed her by the arms and led her down a long, dark hallway. The only light came from the dim glow of the suit's built-in display, which flickered and shifted as she walked. Eve stumbled a few times, but the guards were merciless, pushing her forward with rough shoves.

As they approached her cell, the guards stood back and activated the door with a control screen on the wall. The door slid open with a hiss, and they shoved her inside, causing her to stumble and fall to the ground.

Before she could even pick herself up, one of the guards approached her and injected something into the port on the back of her neck. She felt a sharp sting, and then everything went black.

Hours later, Eve began to stir. She was disoriented at first, unsure of where she was or how much time had passed. It was dark in her cell, and the only sound was the low hum of machinery somewhere in the distance.

As she tried to sit up, she realized that something was wrong. The suit was so tight that she could barely move, and every time she shifted her position, she felt the dildos inside her shift as well, rubbing against her in the most intimate way. She desperately wanted to pee, but the suit prevented her from doing so.

Panic set in as she realized that she was trapped inside her laminate prison, unable to remove it or even relieve herself. She clawed at the material, trying to find a way to pry it off her body, but it was no use. The suit was too strong and too tight.

Tears streamed down her face as she realized that she was completely at the mercy of the prison guards. The suit was designed to keep her completely under their control, and there was nothing she could do to resist.

As the night wore on, Eve's discomfort only grew worse. She could feel her bladder becoming more and more full, but there was nothing she could do about it. The suit had been designed to completely control her bodily functions, leaving her at the mercy of her captors.

Eve tried to keep herself together, to stay calm and focused, but the fear and frustration were overwhelming. She couldn't believe that this was her life now, that she was trapped in this prison suit for the next three months.

Overwhelmed by the sense of hopelessness and despair, Eve's body finally succumbed to exhaustion. She fell into a deep, dreamless sleep, hoping that when she woke up, the nightmare would be over.

<!-- Finally, the exhaustion of the day caught up with her, and Eve drifted off into a fitful sleep, tears still streaming down her face. The suit entered the sleep mode, monitoring her every breath and move, as the darkness of the room enveloped her. All she had now was dreams. -->
