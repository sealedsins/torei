Featured article: [Slave Suit](/wiki/slave-suit)

#content
**Slave suit** is a distinctive garment worn by slaves on the planet Torei. Made of a thin and durable layer of laminate, the suit is designed to be skin-tight and cover the wearer's entire body from neck to toes.

Slave suit is a full-coverage laminate catsuit, usually with a corset and a gasmask with a tinted visor. It is intended to completely cover the wearer's body, obscuring their identity and removing any sense of individuality.

Featured story: [Special Gift](/stories/special-gift)

#content
As the first light of dawn began to filter through the window of her small room, Maria stirred from her sleep. She had grown accustomed to waking up before the sun rose, a regime she had followed for years. It was a typical day for her, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something was different.

She rubbed the sleep from her eyes and sat up in bed, feeling the cool air against her bare skin. She glanced over at the small clock integrated in the nightstand and saw that it was still very early. She knew that she had to get up and start her daily routine, so she swung her legs over the side of the bed and stood up.

As she walked to her closet, Maria knew exactly what she was going to wear. She pulled out the garment and slipped into the suit, feeling the smooth surface of the rubber-like fabric against her skin. Glossy black laminate engulfed her body and clung to her curves like a second skin, emphasizing every contour of her body.

<!-- Welcome to Torei, a planet unlike any other. Located in the vast intergalactic space between Andromeda and the Milky Way, Torei is a remote and enigmatic settlement famous for its odd development history and worldwide practice of matriarchy and chattel slavery. The planet orbits a lone hypervelocity star and is divided into ringdoms along a narrow equatorial band, where the habitable part of the planet is located. Torean architecture is a bizarre mix of neoclassicism, modernity, and cyberpunk, defined by the extensive use of the versatile material known as laminate.

Torei is a world of contrasts, from the dense and urbanized core around the space elevator to the more rural and relaxed pace of life found in the farming ringdoms. The badlands, which make up most of the planet's surface, offer a harsh and dangerous place to hide. Torean fashion is heavily influenced by the use of laminate, with skin-tight clothing, bondage equipment, and a range of unique garments, such as the survival suit and slave suit, dominating the market.

Torean society is regulated by the Triune Ministries, which coordinate international institutions common to all ringdoms. Two biomechanical supercomputers located on the poles of Torei, Dahom and Mazos, have become the true masters of the planet, exerting their own will and influence over the human population. Despite their immense power, they are not without controversy, with some arguing that they represent a significant threat to the autonomy and freedom of Torean people.

Whether you are here to explore the planet's natural wonders, delve into its rich cultural history, or simply experience the thrill of adventure, Torei offers a unique and unforgettable experience. Discover the secrets of this mysterious and captivating world today. -->
