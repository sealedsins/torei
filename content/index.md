**Laminate bed** is a unique and versatile piece of technology that is widely used on Torei. This bed is made entirely of laminate and is designed to completely encase the occupant within two sheets, creating a vacuum-sealed environment that offers a range of applications.

It is designed to provide a comfortable and secure environment for the occupant. When fully sealed, it completely encases the occupant within two laminate sheets, which helps to protect the occupant from external factors such as dust or air pollution.
