This project began as a small experiment to test the limits of modern language models. The objective was to create a sustainable world-building engine that could assist in crafting stories and fictional articles by blending lore information from multiple sources.

The world of [Torei](/wiki), with its unique culture, technology and fashion, was the perfect testing ground for this project. By feeding in data about Torean society, fashion, and government, an advanced neural network was able to craft stories and lore information that are realistic and immersive, allowing readers to get a sense of what life might be like on this distant planet.

The result was this site, a collection of stories and fictional encyclopedia articles that showcase the incredible potential of recent language models to create rich and immersive fictional worlds.

## Creation

As a language model, [ChatGPT (GPT-3)](https://chat.openai.com/chat/) was the centerpiece of this project. By feeding it with carefully selected data about the Torean society and culture, it was able to generate stories, articles, and lore information that expanded on the existing universe.

[Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) was another important tool employed in the development of this project. It was used to create visual representations of Torean fashion, architecture, and technology, providing a more immersive experience for readers exploring the world of Torei.

The creation process was an iterative one, where generated content was reviewed and refined to ensure that it was coherent and consistent with the existing lore. This required a lot of back-and-forth between the language model and real human being, but ultimately it allowed for the creation of a rich and immersive universe that feels alive and dynamic.

## Inspiration

It's worth mentioning that the concept of a bizzare sadomasochistic planet is not something I invented entirely by myself - it's largely based on a fictional universe that exists for [more than ten years](https://gospodin.neocities.org/lead). There were two major sources of inspiration that made a steady foundation for this project:

[Torean Tales](https://gospodin.neocities.org) is a collection of stories and lore that provide an extensive and engaging insight into the culture and history of Torei. It served as the basis for many of the concepts and details incorporated into this setting, including the use of laminate as a clothing material, the prevalence of slavery, and the role of the AIs in Torean society.

[Lost in Laminate](https://iconoclast.neocities.org/), on the other hand, provided a more interactive and hands-on experience for readers to explore the world of Torei. This impressive interactive novel offers a glimpse into the unique fashion, architecture, and technology that make up this planet.
