This project started from a simple prompt. It was a request to write a small story about a young woman trying on a latex suit for the first time. But with each new iteration, the story took on a life of its own, becoming more complex and incorporating new elements and themes - until it became clear that through the power of AI, it was possible to create entire worlds from just a few facts.

As a result, what started as a simple nocturnal experiment evolved into a collection of stories and fictional wiki pages that provide a glimpse into the world of [Torei](/wiki) - an enigmatic planet full of bondage, submission, and technology beyond our wildest dreams.

While it's a relatively modest attempt to explore the possibilities of AI-generated storytelling, I hope that readers will find it interesting and engaging, and perhaps even be inspired to create their own stories and worlds using modern AI technology.

<!-- The world of [Torei](/wiki), with its unique culture, technology and fashion, was the perfect testing ground for this experiment. By feeding in data about Torean society, fashion, and government, an advanced neural network was able to craft stories and lore information that are realistic and immersive, allowing readers to get a sense of what life might be like on this distant planet.

The result was this site, a collection of stories and fictional wiki pages that provide a glimpse into this enigmatic world. While it is a modest attempt to explore the possibilities of AI-generated storytelling, I sincerely hope that readers will find it interesting and engaging, and that it sparks their imagination and curiosity about the potential of AI in creative endeavors. -->

## Creation

_Learn more: [Prompts](/prompts)_

As a language model, [ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)](https://chat.openai.com/chat/) was the centerpiece of this project. By feeding it with carefully selected data about the Torean society and culture, it was able to generate stories, articles, and lore information that expanded on the existing universe.

[Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) was another important tool employed in the development of this project. It was used to create visual representations of Torean fashion, architecture, and technology, providing a more immersive reader experience.

The creation process was an iterative one, where generated content was reviewed and refined to ensure that it was coherent and consistent with the existing lore. This required a lot of back-and-forth between the language model and the human [writer](https://twitter.com/sealedsins), who served as the project's sole editor.

<!-- The end result is a unique and complex universe that explores various themes, including power dynamics, slavery, and biotech, all set against the backdrop of a harsh and unforgiving world. -->

## Inspiration

It's worth mentioning that the concept of a bizarre sadomasochistic planet is not something I invented entirely by myself - it's largely based on a fictional universe that exists for [more than ten years](https://gospodin.neocities.org/lead). There were two major sources of inspiration that made a foundation for this project:

[Torean Tales](https://gospodin.neocities.org) is a collection of stories and lore information that provide an extensive and engaging insight into the culture and history of Torei. It served as the basis for many of the concepts and details incorporated into this setting, including the use of laminate as a clothing material, the prevalence of slavery, and the role of the AIs in Torean society.

[Lost in Laminate](https://iconoclast.neocities.org/), on the other hand, is an interactive fiction that explores Torei from a first-person perspective, immersing the reader into the world of Torei and its unique customs and practices. It offers a more personal and intimate look at life on Torei, including the various types of laminate garments and their uses, as well as the different forms of slavery and their implications.

<!-- Together, these sources provided a comprehensive understanding of the world of Torei and its distinctive culture. -->
